# Probability of Default (PD) — Default Prediction Case

This repository contains **Jupyter Notebooks** for a **credit risk data science case** focused on **Probability of Default (PD)** modeling.

The project combines **interpretable baseline models** with **advanced machine learning** to predict borrower default risk.

## Methodology

- Data quality checks and class imbalance analysis  
- Exploratory data analysis and statistical testing  
- Feature engineering and binning  
- **Logistic Regression** as a benchmark PD model  
- **XGBoost classifier** for non-linear risk modeling  
- **Optuna** for hyperparameter optimization  
- Stratified K-Fold cross-validation  
- Threshold tuning and cost-aware evaluation  

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- ROC-AUC, KS, Gini  
- Confusion matrix and recall/precision trade-offs  

---

## Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn)  
- XGBoost  
- Optuna  

---

## Business Objective

To estimate **Probability of Default** for credit decisioning, portfolio risk management, and model comparison under real-world constraints.
